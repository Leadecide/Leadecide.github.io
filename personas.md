# Personas & use-cases 

##What is a persona?

Personas are character sketches of fictional contributors and users who might do something with the Open Leadership Framework. We created personas for the Open Leadership Framework based on participants in past open leadership trainings and events.

Below you’ll find 3 personas. Each persona has a before story, a use-case story, and an after story showing how their interactions with the Open Leadership Framework changed the way they worked and led in the open. Each example is meant to suggest ways we might interact with - and learn from -  the framework, as well.

##Personas

### Mimi, the non-profit deputy director

####Before

Mimi is a deputy director for community engagement at a non-profit dedicated to improving Internet access for the urban poor. Mimi wants to help her non-profit grow by attracting new audiences and communities to the issue of Internet access and by expanding the number of ways people from those new audiences and communities can contribute to the work. She finds the Open Leadership Framework paper through a social-media feed she follows. She attends the online office-hours for the framework, shares a few stories of challenges and successes she has had, and asks questions about how to design and build community interactions that might empower her colleagues and communities to spread their work.
 
####Use-case

Mimi takes the ideas she got during the office hours call and begins working on a project to identify shared values between her organization and contributors who have helped in the past. She uses the [project design assessment use-case](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSesg4Uk7Znn5VawGQd99eTIlAsNyPXv9TdLeJhfYj2mxtlv4w/viewform?usp=sf_link) to see how well her plans align with the principles, practices, and skills of the Open Leadership Framework.

####After

To find support for her project, Mimi applies for the next round of online Open Leadership mentoring with a project focused on enhancing the value exchange for community members who join co-ops for better Internet access and for contributors who help with the documentation and training needed to set up those co-ops. She recruits new contributors to the project through the next Global Sprint and proposes a session about sharing the results of her project at the next MozFest.

### Hector, the open evangelist

####Before

Hector is an evangelist for openness working at a media policy non-profit. A colleague emails him a link they found to the Open Leadership Framework. Hector spends an afternoon reviewing and critiquing the framework and then imagines ways he might adapt and apply its principles, practices, and skills in his own work and in his organization.

####Use-case

Hector tries the [self-assessment use-case](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSds8B2aj6K0h7EwdKDBdqpIkGxReyOgrA4QRhrLim-Ags4rUw/viewform?usp=sf_link) to see how well his beliefs and practices align with the framework and to identify areas of personal and professional development he might pursue as a self-identified open leader. He finds that while he often designs and builds projects for open participation, he doesn’t empower others to take on leadership roles in his projects as much as he thought he did.

####After

Through a follow-up conversation with members of Mozilla’s Open Leadership & Events team, Hector learns about the MIT Open Leadership Camp and attends the next round with his executive director to learn how they might better delegate leadership of their organization’s projects to more staffers and community volunteers.

### Kellie, the computer science grad student

#### Before

Kellie is a grad student in computer science with a passion for using government data for public good. One of her professors recommends participating in Mozilla's Open Leaders program. She joins the next cohort with a project meant to compare and contrast infrastructure projects in industrial and residential areas of her home state. While Kellie has designed and built out several data collection projects on her own using tools like GitHub, she hasn't worked on a project with contributors before, and she'd like this project to involve citizens, civil servants, and peers working to collect and analyze similar data. She uses her time in the cohort to solicit ideas about designing and building her project to empower others to contribute and then replicate the project.

#### Use-case

At the end of her cohort, Kellie uses the [project post-mortem use-case](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScckWbuQuXut4y_Brp3yTr9dqPVPPwdlaxMyM_8cFLgACSFaA/viewform?usp=sf_link) to assess how well her project aligned with the principles, practices, and skills of the Open Leadership Framework. She discovers that her project did a great job of networking and empowering the contributors she recruited to maintain this work even after her cohort is over.

#### After

Kellie returns to the Open Leaders program as a mentor and expert in the next round, coaching a small group of new participants and consulting with other project leads who are working with open data. Reflecting on her project and experiences as an Open Leaders mentor and expert, Kellie also publishes a blog post called "10 Ways to Empower Citizens to Own Civic Data" that becomes part of the open leadership curriculum shared by Mozilla.

## Reflection

Which of these personas seems most familiar to you? Which use-case might apply to your work, as well? We hope you’ll use these personas as another way to explore how the Open Leadership Framework might help you in your personal and professional development.
