# Open Leadership Map Whitepaper v.0.4 (public alpha)

* TOC
{:toc}

## Hello & Welcome!

Hi! We’re Mozilla, a global non-profit fueling the movement for Internet health. Our mission is to ensure the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all. We work for an Internet that truly puts people first, where individuals can shape their own experience and are empowered, safe and independent.

A healthy Internet helps people live and learn online. It includes everyone in its possibilities. It belongs to the people and resists being closed off or broken apart. On a healthy Internet, we are all free to share and benefit from one another's innovative, new ideas because of a culture of inclusivity, openness, and care. We work together there to fight harassment, engage critically with media, and help ourselves and our communities to maintain control of our own online lives.

Some big ideas connected to [Internet health](https://internethealthreport.org/) include:

- **Privacy and Security:** being able to use the internet without having to worry about being followed or influenced by outside parties and without getting hacked for information through your connection, devices, public Wifi, or accounts you have with companies, governments, or other external contacts.

- **Decentralization:** getting your online news, shopping, entertainment, and information from sources that are independent, varied, and chosen by you personally—not originating from a single information source or from a group of sources working together to appear independent.

- **Openness:** having equal access to software code, tools, and databases, allowing the entire global community to expand the internet’s capabilities without having to solve problems that have already been solved or build under threat of broad and undefined intellectual property laws.

- **Digital Inclusion:** empowering all people, regardless of race, income, nationality, or gender, to thrive online in their unique differences and to create an ecosystem of respect, accountability, and neutrality—not exclusivity, harassment, or discrimination.

- **Web Literacy:** having the skills you need to participate as empowered digital citizens who see the underlying internet as a living resource they can use, going beyond just web-content consumption and having all the skills they need to navigate, share, evaluate what information to trust, and most importantly, to expand the frontiers of knowledge.

Think of Internet health and these big ideas as the “what” and “why” of what we do. Our commitment to these core values drives our work.

Open Leadership is the “how” of our work. It’s how we accomplish our work in communities, organizations, and projects. Open Leadership encompases the processes and resources we use to support Internet health for everyone’s benefit.

Open leaders “work open.” They work collaboratively, sharing the ownership of  ideas, resources, and outcomes with contributors, while building powerful, diverse communities to support and direct projects and organizations. They also set the conditions for others to do the same, ensuring accountability, equity, and transparency in a project and its community.

Here are some examples of how Open Leaders work on the “what” and “why” of their projects and organizations:

- In [The Mozilla Italia l10n Guide](https://medium.com/read-write-participate/mozilla-italia-l10n-guide-e6f6d36b45bb), Sara Todaro uses [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/kitsunenosaraT/Mozilla-Italia-l10n-guide/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to outline how others can participate in the project.

- In [UofT coders](https://uoftcoders.github.io), their leadership team uses the [personas and pathways](https://github.com/UofTCoders/council/blob/master/Personas-and-pathways.md) exercise to identify potential blockers to participation.

- In [The Method Podcast](https://themethodpodcast.com/), April Clyburne-Sherin includes many different ways to submit audio to make participation as easy as possible.

- [openSNP](https://opensnp.org/) allows customers of direct-to-customer genetic tests to publish their test results, find others with similar genetic variations, learn more about their results by getting the latest primary literature on their variations, and help scientists find new associations.

- Jos de Block, founder of [Buurtzorg](http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Case_Examples_of_Successful_Journeys#Buurtzorg) in the Netherlands, created an innovative neighborhood nursing company that shares its business model freely with competitors to improve elder care for all (Laloux, 2016).

- Nora Dashwood, COO of [the Decurion Corporation](https://www.inc.com/ilan-mochari/an-everyone-culture-employee-training-development.html), facilitates an internal, communal governance process that allows all employees to contribute insights to decision-making and participates in culture of constant feedback in which any employee can give another feedback safely, regardless of relative position (Kegan & Lahey, 2015).

- Jim Whitehurst, CEO of [RedHat](https://www.redhat.com/en/explore/the-open-organization-book), oversees an “inclusive” decision-making process that provides employees with the opportunity to weigh in on decisions that affect them and to get all the information they need to address their concerns before giving feedback. (Whitehurst, 2014).

This white paper will help you understand, adapt, and use Open Leadership practices to further your work in the Internet health movement and beyond.

Together, we can use the principles and practices of Open Leadership to build a healthy Internet reflective of the society we want to see in the world. We are glad to be doing this work alongside you. Welcome to the Mozilla Network!

## What Is Open?

Openness includes deals and practices that any kind of community, project, or organization can practice.

These three principles help define openness:

- **Understanding:** You make the work accessible and clear.
- **Extensibility:** You make the work easy to adapt, reproduce, and share.
- **Participation & inclusion:** You build shared ownership and agency with contributors through accountability, equity, and transparency to make the work inviting, relevant,  safe, and sustainable for all.

At its core, being “open” is about structuring any project or organization, technical or not, to invite the widest possible diversity of contributors. Who are contributors? People who give time, expertise, and labor to a project. A project that supports diverse contributors creates an inclusive community of people working together because of the interests and passions they share. That community includes new “insiders” who may have once felt like they were “outsiders.”  Open projects also return value to their contributors to compensate them somehow for their work. Open practices like shared decision-making, conflict-resolution, and mentorship help people feel welcome, safe, and inspired.

Furthermore, when a project is fully open it invites contributions from anyone. Open projects share their processes, workflows, and outcomes through accessible platforms and open licensing. This kind of sharing is what we traditionally mean when we talk about an open project. It maximizes impact by clearing some obstacles, like cost, out of your users’ way. It also encourages and incentivizes adoption by letting users change and build off your work to better suit their needs, amplifying the usefulness and reach of your project through new and unexpected user-generated outcomes.

Leads and contributors can also open projects that are not only or essentially technical in nature. Projects that serve the public good through educational programming or other forms of activism can be open, as well.

The altruism and idealism of openness connect people to one another through projects and organizations that invite them to build together for social good.

However, not every open project or organization is fully open. Requiring a project or organization to open everything all the time would be a high barrier to entry. The Open Leadership Map (shared below)  is meant to help you think intentionally and strategically about when, how, and why to work open according to the needs of your contributors and community, whether they’re employees or volunteers, and whether you’re part of a fully open, community-serving social enterprise, non-profit, or research project or something else, like a for-profit company. The big idea is to discover how you can lead your project or organization to be more open, inclusive, and effective in making a difference in your contributors’ lives and in the world through increasingly open practices.

## What Is Open Leadership?

Open Leaders **design**, **build**, and **empower** contributors, projects and organizations to promote openness and social good throughout their work and across society. They **design**, **build**, and **empower** for **understanding**, **extensibility**, and **participation and inclusion**, the key principles of openness.

- **Design:** You plan projects for contributors and users’ specific needs and capacities.
- **Build:** You create systems and solutions that maximize a project’s clarity, usability, and inclusiveness.
- **Empower:** You help contributors own the work through transparency, accountability, and shared decision-making.

The skills, competencies, and outcomes of Open Leadership can help you mobilize your community, think strategically about how to advance its work through open practices, and develop your own personal leadership style that inspires contribution and models openness.

The benefits of Open Leadership include improving the quality of your work, increasing its efficiency and innovation, lowering its costs, and increasing its discoverability and reach in the world (Klepel, 2017). The Hive Research Lab affirms that working open leads to improved projects, greater efficiency, increased discoverability, and a stronger public commons (Santo, Ching, Peppler & Hoadley, 2014).

These goals and their strategic benefits might look slightly different across contexts.

For example, different types of organizations might realize these benefits slightly differently.

![A table showing the benefits of openness to for-profit, non-profit, advocacy-based, and public sector organizations concerning improved quality, improved efficiency, and improved reach](images/why-open-table.png)

Across contexts, Open Leadership is facilitative and service-oriented in that it helps communities of contributors and users create relevant, functional solutions to personally and collectively meaningful problems through shared accountability, agency, decision-making, ownership, and responsibility.

Of course, these benefits come with costs. It takes time and effort to open a closed project, to resolve conflicts, and to make decisions that stay true to openness. It takes time to design, test, and improve systems. There aren’t shortcuts to accountability, equity, and transparency. Being open often means being messy. Sometimes it feels like a project is getting worse - like there are more issues and tensions to resolve than ever - before it gets better. Openness uncovers what your project and its community need to work on in terms of creating authentic, shared ownership of the work. You can only realize the benefits of this approach through a sustained commitment to a project, its people, and open principles.

Right now, you may be working on a closed project that you’d like to open, or you might be working on a project that practices a kind of constant, “shout it from the rooftops” kind of open  (Thompson, 2011). At any point in your Open Leadership journey, this guide and the Open Leadership Map are meant to help you reflect on your work, share what you do with others, and take your next step to grow as a leader.

Shortly, we’ll take a closer look at how **designing**, **building**, and **empowering** for **understanding**, **extensibility**, and **participation and inclusion** break down into specific skills and competencies below.

## Open Leadership Is Not…

Let’s pause for a moment and clear up a few common misconceptions about Open Leadership before we look at the Open Leadership Map.

Open Leadership is not (Thompson, 2011):

- A way to get free labor.
- A way to avoid process or structure.
- A way to hit your deadline faster.

Instead, Open Leadership requires you to:

- Clearly communicate the goals of your project and the value of working on your project.
- Create robust, transparent systems for content development, governance, and information-sharing.
- Test and revise your work until it meets your community’s needs.

It takes rigor to practice Open Leadership and your contributors and communities will hold you accountable for maintaining the openness of your shared work.

## The Open Leadership Map

Open leadership is a set of practices and skills people can use to mobilize their communities to solve shared problems and achieve shared goals.

Open leaders are guided by open **principles**. They strive for:

- **Understanding:** They make the work accessible and clear.
- **Extensibility:** They make the work easy to adapt, reproduce, and share.
- **Participation & inclusion:** They make the work inviting, relevant, and safe for all.

To apply these principles, open leaders take these **actions**. They:

- **Design:** They make contextual, deliberate decisions about how and when to be open.
- **Build:** They create structures, and systems that ensure clarity and process-based management.
- **Empower:** They model personal leadership skills that sustain them and their contributors.

As a result, open leaders and their communities, organizations, and projects work towards these objectives. They help their communities, organizations, and projects:
Improve the efficiency, quality, and relevance of their work.
Discover new, innovative solutions that make sense to them.
Increase the discoverability, reach, lifespan and usefulness of their work.

Not every community, organization, or project works towards all of those objectives, principles, or actions at once. Instead, open leaders work with their contributors - the people who give their time, talent, and expertise to a project - to focus on the elements that will help them achieve shared goals. For example, a local project might first work to IMPROVE EFFICIENCY, QUALITY, AND RELEVANCE. Later, it might share more to INCREASE THE DISCOVERABILITY, REACH, LIFESPAN and USEFULNESS of its work. Then another community could DISCOVER NEW, INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS localized for them.

This Open Leadership Map suggests areas of focus you can concentrate on during your Open leadership journey to achieve these goals. **To use the map, consider your objective(s) and look at the principles, actions, and embedded skills that might best help you reach your goals.**

![A table or map showing the embedded skills that align with each principle and action of open leadership](images/olm-framework-bw.png)

We’ll dive into each section of the map below.

## Design

These are the strategic prompts Open Leaders use to set goals and determine the levels of openness their projects will have in terms of operations and interactions with their communities. This is how Open Leaders decide what to share, how to share it, and why to share it that way. Open Leaders use the skills and practices of **design** to boost the quality of their work and extend its reach.

![This organizer shows the actions and embedded skills of Design](images/olm-design.png)

When you design, you remain open to:

- Questioning when, how, and why you bring openness to each part of your project or organization in an intentional, strategic way that informs how you **build** things and **empower** people for maximum impact.
- Evaluating the most inclusive, efficient levels of openness for content development, governance (or decision-making), and information-sharing for your project or organization to reach as many people as possible with the highest quality work you have to share.
- Determining how best to interact with contributors and community members to fuel participation and innovation without exploiting others under cover of openness (Klepel, 2017).

As an Open Leader develops, they begin to think about:

- How to align the management practices of **build** with the strategic decisions they make.
- How to develop the personal leadership skills from **empower** that can help them share ownership of strategic decisions with contributors.

A breakdown of each section follows.

### Design for Understanding

- Content focus
  - Defines and manages the openness of core content like products and services.
- Community interaction: learning through use
  - Strategically structures community engagement opportunities to generate data and feedback that can be used to improve the work.

### Design for Extensibility

- Information-sharing focus
  - Strategically manages the openness of information sharing between the project or organization and external communities.
- Community interaction: gifting
  - Strategically structures community engagement opportunities to encourage adoption and use by sharing information and content freely.
- Community interaction: enhancing value exchange
  - Strategically structures community engagement opportunities to encourage adoption and use by recognizing the value of contributions and compensating contributors in ways they value for their work.
- Community interaction: networking common interests
  - Strategically structures community engagement opportunities to encourage adoption and use by connecting people, communities, and networks demonstrating passionate for the work.

### Design for Participation & Inclusion

- Governance focus
  - Strategically manages the openness of governance and decision-making processes within the project or organization.
- Community interaction: creating together
  - Strategically structures community engagement opportunities to encourage adoption and use by inviting process-based co-creation of information and content through contributions and shared decision-making.
- Community interaction: soliciting ideas
  - Strategically structures community engagement opportunities to encourage adoption and use by researching community needs.

## Build

These are the concrete principles, skills, and competencies Open Leaders need to structure and manage projects and communities. This is how Open Leaders define a project and establish its guidelines and workflow.

![This organizer shows the actions and embedded skills of Build](images/olm-build.png)

When you build your project or organization, you remain open to:

- Communicating in a way that makes the goals and processes of your project or organization as clear as possible to potential contributors and communities of practice.
- Evaluating and adopting the open practices, platforms and tools that will extend and sustain your project’s reach.
- Implementing the most inclusive community-management practices and structures you and your contributors devise together to share power and decision-making across the project or organization.

As Open Leaders develop they begin to think about:

- How to employ these principles, competencies, and skills in increasingly intentional and strategic ways that complement the their goals, operational decisions, and community interactions from **design**.
- How to enact these principles, competencies, and skills in ways that foster openness and fuel stakeholders’ capacity and passion for the work using personal leadership practices from **empower**.

A breakdown of each build sections follows.

## Empower

These are personal leadership competencies and skills Open Leaders use to share capacity, passion, and power within and across projects, organizations, communities, and networks. This is how Open Leaders manage themselves to spread vision, passion, projects and openness.

![This organizer shows the actions and embedded skills of Empower](images/olm-empower.png)

When you empower others, you remain open to:

- Addressing your own blind-spots.
- Listening to criticism (even when it’s about you) and growing from it.
- Using feedback (even from failures) to improve the work.
- Balancing competing tensions in a project that drive innovation and progress.
- Sharing and addressing your own vulnerabilities.

As an Open Leader develops, they begin to think about:

- How their personal leadership style empowers colleagues and contributors to realize the benefits of working open through the decision-making processes of **design**.
- How their personal leadership skills combine with core open practices from **build** and **design** to inspire people across projects, organizations, networks, communities, and society.

A breakdown of each section follows.
